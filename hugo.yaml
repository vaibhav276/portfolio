  # TODO: Work on this more after reading some data visualization theory
  sidebarAbout: 
    - I like simplifying data and ideas to people
    - I have worked for 17 years as Software Engineer and Architect in data oriented companies and products, and found that efficiently conveying information to humans is at the heart of any successful system.
    - With massive amounts of data collected every day, the need to draw intuition from all of it is ever more important.
