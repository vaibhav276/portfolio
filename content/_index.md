# Hello :wave:

I am a software engineer with 17+ years of development, design and architecture experience in product and service based organizations. I have worked on many small and large scale applications. In summary, here are some (non-exhaustive) keywords outlining my roles and kind of tech stacks I worked with:
* Java
* Spring Boot
* Microservices
* Architecture
* Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Angular
* React
* Full stack developer
* Backend developer
* Product discovery
* Devops

Summarizing the past in keywords can be very lossy as it doesn't capture the most important things. I have learnt that there are no shortcuts to greatness, and one must sincerely attempt to simplify the problem to its essentials as early in the process as possible. I believe in first-principles thinking and like to use that to build rock-solid foundations for applications of any scale and technology stack.

Visit [Projects](./projects/) page to see some demo projects I did.
