# Hello :wave:

I am a software engineer with 17+ years of development, design and architecture experience in product and service based organizations. During my career so far, I have experienced many aspects of software development like
* Low-level designing of classes and interfaces in object oriented languages like Java and C++
* Hunting for nasty memory bugs hiding in a large applications written in C, only to realize someone forgot to do a `memset` somewhere, or someone incorrectly parsed a struct object
* Remote debugging in customer environments across continents
* Celebrating that 2% performance improvement
* Doing product discovery with Product manager and User Experience partners, preparing for a dozen directions we could take, and not knowing which one is the right one
* Designing small and large process related things like code version control strategy
* Having mind blowing conversations with colleagues on writing the product from scratch and how we would do things differently
* Figuring out cloud-native and cloud-agnostic solutions for every problem
* ... and so on ...

During all this seemingly long-winded walk through the weeds, I have gained invaluable experience as an engineer and my passion for becoming a better engineer has only grown. I know that there are really no shortcuts to greatness. I like to develop applications of any kind by simplification and boiling them down to the basics. I believe in first-principles thinking and would like to use that to offer rock-solid foundations for applications of any scale and technology stack.
